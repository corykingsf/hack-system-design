although I had the book, I purchased the course today. I've in the process of interviewing at the FAANG companies, and the ones in the same bracket although not in the acronym.
Yesterday, I had an SD interview with one of the FAANG companies where I was asked to design a system to collect logs from potentially thousands of servers, and make them available for searching. I began the interview by saying that Splunk, Elastic Search and many others have been doing this for years, so outside the interview, I'd not try to reinvent the wheel, and simply pay for a known, off the shelf  product. Then the interviewer spent 25 min out of 40 drilling down on the database design.
I'm still waiting for the feedback, so, I will soon find out how I did.
